**Rust bindings for [JUCE](https://juce.com/) using [cxx](https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx).**

## Overview

JUCE is something of an industry standard for audio applications, so it would be nice to be able to make use of it from
Rust.

Providing bindings for the entirety of JUCE would be a huge undertaking, and much of it would be duplicating
functionality already available to Rust in the standard library or via crates.io.

The goal for this crate is to provide bindings for a subset of JUCE, in particular the mature and thoroughly
battle-tested audio modules.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
cxx-juce = "0.3"
```

## Dependencies

Refer to the [JUCE documentation](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE#building-juce-projects) for the dependencies
required to build JUCE on your platform.
